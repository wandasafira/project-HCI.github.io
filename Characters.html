                As the eldest son from the Mugi family, Akihiro had already trained to be a swordsman
                since early age as the successor of Akihiro's father. Now Akihiro is considered to be the best
                samurai in the world of Bakudan.

                Eiji refuses to use a sword as his main weapon because of his past when a group of evil samurai
                tried to end his life. Now he uses a spear and a schimitar as his main weapon after training
                for 20 years so that he can protect his own.

                Kazuo was once the head bodyguard of Mugi family and had been close friends with Akihiro. But then
                he was framed by his fellow bodyguard and was kicked out of the Mugi Household. After planning for
                revenge he secretly trained with Akihiro to gain more strength.

                Toshio is an assassin from another land. His name was feared in the battlefield and people
                would ignore problems if it is related to Toshio. His swordsmanship is excellent and is on
                the same level with Akihiro. Toshio travelled to Bakudan for a new life, but is it going to change
                for him?
